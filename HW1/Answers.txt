2. What are the difference between value type and reference type variables? What is
boxing and unboxing?
Value types vs Reference types
1. Value type will directly hold the value while reference type will hold the memory address or reference for the value
2. Value type will be stored in a stack memory while reference type are stored in the heap memory
3. Value type will not be collected by garbage collector but reference type will be collected by the garbage collector
4. Value type can be created by struct or enum while reference type can be created by class, interface, delegates or array.
5. Value type cannot accept any null values while reference type can accept null values.

Boxing is the conversion from value type to reference type or object type while unboxing is the conversion from reference type to value type

3. What is meant by the terms managed resource and unmanaged resource in .NET
The managed resource are resources that .NET runtime (CLR) manages automatically through the garabage collector.
Unmanaged resource are resources that must be manually released through calling Dispose() method of IDisposable interface.

4. What is the purpose of Garbage Collector in .NET?
garbage collector works as automatic memory manager but only works in heap memory.
Cannot call garbage collector in c#, it will automatically work when an object has no reference to it.
