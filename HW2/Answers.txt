1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C# ?

Use String when working with immutable text. Since String objects cannot be modified after creation, 
any modification (concatenation, replacement) creates a new object, 
leading to performance overhead in loops or large text operations.

Use StringBuilder when modifying strings frequently. 
StringBuilder is mutable, meaning it modifies the same object, making it more efficient for string concatenation.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
The base class for all arrays in C# is System.Array

3. How do you sort an array in C#?
You can sort an array using Array.Sort() or Array.Reverse()

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in
an array?
Length property is used to get the total number of elements.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?
No, System.Array requires elements of the same type.
However, you can store multiple types using object[] (since object is the base type of all classes).

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between the System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?
CopyTo() copies to an existing array, Clone() creates a new array.
